# Welcome

Hello, I am Tera Thomas. My background in academic and clinical research has launched me into the fascinating world of data analysis. I have a deep rooted passion for healthcare innovation and patient care quality. 

I welcome you to my digital portfolio, where you can explore some of my work with health care data analytics. 

The work you will see below was conducted through SQL (PgAdmin), Excel, and Tableau. 

# Sample Patient Population Analyzing: Patients, Encounters, Conditions and Immunizations

Below you will explore a sample population provided by "Data Wizardry", retrieved from Data.CMS.gov.
The patient population was filtered using SQL, and analyzed through Excel. The visuals you will 
see were created in Tableau.

This analysis covered:

**21,670** individual patient encounters

**10** different payer groups

**7** different encounter classes

**4** different joined databases (patients, encounters, conditions, immunizations)
