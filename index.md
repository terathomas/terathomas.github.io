# Welcome

Welcome to my portfolio where you can explore some of my work with health care data analysis. 
The work you will see below was conducted through SQL (PgAdmin), Excel, and Tableau. 


## Sample Patient Population Analyzing: Patients, Encounters, Conditions and Immunizations

Below you will explore a sample population provided by "Data Wizardry", retrieved from Data.CMS.gov.
The patient population was filtered using SQL, and analyzed through Excel. The visuals you will 
see were created in Tableau.

This analysis covered *21,670* individual patient encounters. *10* different payer groups.  *7* different encounter classes. And *4* different joined databases (patients, encounters, conditions, immunizations).

## Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule Private Payer Rates and Volumes 

Below you will explore a sample analysis using data provided by Data.CMS.gov.

The images provided were taken from a presentation created to represent the 
data findings. A similar presentation could be used for hospital administrators
or health care providers within the clinic environment.

![TopOrdered](https://terathomas.github.io/images/TopOrdered.jpeg)

This chart represents the top 15 ordered codes used within this sample.

![TopRevenue](https://terathomas.github.io/images/TopRevenue.jpeg)

This chart represents the top 15 highest earning codes within this sample.
Note, some of the most frequently ordered codes are *not* the highest earning.

![Var](https://terathomas.github.io/images/Var.jpeg)
 
 This plot demonstrates wide variability demonstrated for the most
 frequently ordered code. 

 This result demonstrates an urgent need to examine the reason behind the
 extreme outliers within the sample. 

![VarExcludeOutlier](https://terathomas.github.io/images/VarExcludeOutlier.jpeg)

This is the same plot as previous, but with the outlier removed. 
You can see how it reduced the average price and standard deviation for this order.
